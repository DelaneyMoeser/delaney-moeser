    <p>Hello! My name is Delaney Moeser, and I am pursuing a career in web development.</p>
    <p>Although I'm still very early in my journey, I've been studying The Odin Project to build a strong foundation in coding development.</p>
    <p>I have discovered a real passion for working with code and solving problems, and I'm excited to continue learning and growing in this field!</p>
    <p>In the future, I plan on studying software engineering once I feel confident in my web development skills.</p>
    <p>My ultimate goal is to become part of a supportive team where I can contribute, learn, and help build impactful projects.</p>
    <p>I'm eager to connect with others in the tech community, and I'd love to collaborate or hear from anyone who shares similar interest!</p>
